## Introduction

**RM2DM** is a tool for automatic generation of *OO design model* from *requirements models*. The **benefits** of RM2DM are as follows:

1. Automatic generation of the class diagram. RM2DM can generate fabricated classes, decompose the system operations into primitive operations and encapsulate primitive operations into classes. The class diagram describes the design of the static structure of the system.
2. Automatic generation of sequence diagrams. RM2DM can generate sequence diagrams for each system operation based on system sequence diagrams and system operation contracts. Unlike system sequence diagrams that describe the interactions between users and the system, sequence diagrams illustrate the dynamic behavioral design inside the system in terms of how objects within the system collaborate to accomplish system operations.

## RM2DM Installation
### Prerequest

RM2DM is an advanced feature of **RM2PT**. We recommend you to use RM2DM in RM2PT. If you don't have RM2PT, download [here](https://rm2pt.com/downloads/).

### Online Installation
Open RM2PT, click on `Help` -> `Install New Software`

### Offline Installation

**If the update site does not work**, you can choose to install it offline. Click [here](https://github.com/RM2PT/RM2DM-UpdateSite/releases/download/v1.0.0/com.rm2pt.generator.design.updatesite-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip) to download RM2DM. Follow the steps below to install.

## RM2DM Tutorial 

### Prerequest

In order to generate the documentation, you need a requirements model, the **RM2PT project**. For creating or importing a RM2PT projectï¼Œyou can see the tutorial [here](https://rm2pt.com/tutorial/user/create_new_project). We recommend importing RM2PT projects from Git, which is avaliable at [CaseStudies](https://github.com/RM2PT/CaseStudies). The tutorial is [here](https://rm2pt.com/tutorial/user/import_rm2pt_project).

### Generate Design Model

Here we use CoCoME as an example.

After you import CoCoME requirements model from Git, you can generate the design model from the requirements model by right click on `cocome.remodel` -> `RM2PT-Dev`-> `Generate Design Model`


<img src="../../imgs/RM2DM/GenerateDesignModel.png" alt="GenerateDesignModel" style="zoom: 80%;" />

The generated design model is in the DesignModel folder
