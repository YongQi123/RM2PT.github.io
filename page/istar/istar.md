## Goal2UCM
### case study
  We will take the process of interaction between cashiers and customers in CoCoME (supermarket shopping system) in the RM2PT case as the case of this experiment. The description of this process is mainly as follows:

  First, cashier can perform three actions: OpenCashDesk, CloseCashDesk and processSale. This part constitutes a simple use case diagram. The ‘processSale’ action, can be expanded  to get the system sequence diagram. This part mainly reflects the interaction with customers. First, makeNewSale is initiated and then the enterItem loop is initiated, requiring the customers to provide the cashier with barcode and quantity information about the goods until it ends. then we proceed to the next action, endSale. Finally, a selection to either MakeCashPayment or MakeCardPayment is needed. If cash payment is chosen, a specific amount is required. If on the other hand card payment chosen, the card account number, expiry date and fee is required. The last part is the domain model, which mainly preserves the entity data of the above process. The stored data include ‘cashDesk’, cashier, payment, ‘cashPayment’, ‘cardPayment’, item and ‘salesLineItem’.

  According to the above conditions, we need to create the corresponding Goal model. First, create a cashier of role type with three goals: openCashDesk, closeCashDesk and processSale. Set them to goal. In order to achieve the goal of ‘processSale’, we need to do the following four tasks. The first task is to make a new sale, set it as a task element, and connect it with ‘processSale’ through ‘AndRefinement’, so that this task belongs to the above goal, and then connect it to the next ‘Task’ through ‘previousTask’, so that the order between tasks can be obtained. The second task is the ‘enterItem’. In addition to the above operations, because this is a loop in a special task, its two properties ‘isCombinedFragment’ and ‘isLoop’ should be set to true. In this way, the task will have the loop property during conversion. The third task is ‘endSale’, which is a common task. It only needs to do the same operation as the first task. The last task, payment is also a special task. It is the choice of a special task. In addition to the basic operation, its two properties ‘isCombinedFragment’ and ‘MethodAlt’ should be set to true. To accomplish this task, you need to perform two new tasks. The first one is MakeCashPayment, which is connected to the task Payment with ‘OrRefinement’. The second is ‘MakeCardPayment’, which is connected to the task Payment with ‘OrRefinement’.

  Then create a Role type customer, which is used to simulate the user's operation. The user's goal is only one ‘PurchaseGoods’, which is set as the goal element. In order to achieve this goal, two tasks need to be done. The first one is to ProvideProductInformation, which is connected with the goal with ‘AndRefinement’. The second is ‘pay’, which is also linked to the target with ‘AndRefinement’. The next step is to complete the information exchange between the cashier and the user. When the cashier goes to the ‘enterItem’ task, the user's ‘ProvideProductInformation’ task needs to provide the cashier with relevant product information. Use Resource (which belongs to Dependency type) to create the elements barcode and quantity to be passed. The two tasks are connected by ‘dependeElmt / dependerElmt’. When the cashier goes to the "makeCashPayment" task, the user's "pay" task needs to provide the cashier with relevant commodity information, use Resource to create the element amount that needs to be passed, and connect the task through dependeElmt / dependerElmt. When the cashier goes to the ‘makeCardPayment’ task, the user's ‘pay’ task needs to provide the cashier with relevant commodity information, use resource to create the elements ‘CardAccountNumber’, ‘expiryDate’ and ‘fee’ that need to be passed, and connect the three tasks through ‘dependeElmt / dependerElmt’.

  The last part is the entity part. You can fill in the required entity information in this part. Here, you can fill in the information mentioned in the UML domain diagram in ‘CashDesk’, Cashier, Payment, CashPayment, CardPayment, Item and SalesLineItem, and add the Item and SalesLineItem in them, Connect with Resources’s barcode and quantity.
